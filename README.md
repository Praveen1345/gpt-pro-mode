Overview
- GPT Pro Mode gives you a ready-to-run server that uses advanced prompts, caching strategies, and generation control to deliver consistent AI reasoning for complex tasks. It pairs a fast API with optional notebook tutorials to help you see how the model reasoning unfolds step by step.
- The project emphasizes practical tools over fluff. You get a self-contained API, clear prompts, and a path to extend the system with custom modules, safety rules, or domain-specific prompts.

What you can build with GPT Pro Mode
- Complex explanations that stay on topic across multiple generations.
- Step-by-step reasoning, with traceable intermediate results.
- Structured data returns, like tables or JSON schemas, from natural language prompts.
- Guided experimentation in research or product design tasks.

Key features
- Lightweight API server built with a modern Python stack.
- Simple deployment with a single command to start the server.
- Flexible prompt templates that you can swap without code changes.
- Support for multiple generations per request and easy aggregation of results.
- Optional notebook integration to demonstrate concepts and workflows.
- Safe defaults and clear error messages to help you debug quickly.

Architecture and design
- API layer: A small, fast FastAPI app runs behind Uvicorn. It exposes a minimal surface area: a single /pro-mode endpoint for core functionality.
- Prompt layer: The system uses a library of prompt templates. Each template is designed to guide the model toward structured, useful outputs.
- Generation layer: The service allows multiple generations per request. It can average, select, or combine results to produce robust answers.
- Caching: Results can be cached to improve speed for repeated prompts. Cache strategies help reduce API latency on repeated work.
- Notebook layer: Two Colab notebooks demonstrate the concepts in a hands-on way. They help you see how prompts, generation counts, and output formats affect results.

Notebooks and how to use them
- gpt-oss-pro-mode notebook: A practical notebook that demonstrates open science operations and safe testing practices. Opened via Colab with the badge linked above.
- gpt-5-pro-mode notebook: A deeper dive into multi-generation scenarios and advanced reasoning demonstrations. Opened via Colab with the badge linked above.
- How to use the notebooks: Open each Colab link, run the cells, and follow along with the prompts and outputs. The notebooks illustrate how the Pro Mode ideas map to real prompts, responses, and validation steps.
- Why notebooks matter: They give you tangible examples of prompt engineering, ensure you can reproduce results, and provide a sandbox to test hypotheses before integrating into production.

Getting started
- Prerequisites
  - A valid OpenAI API key with access to the models you plan to use.
  - Python 3.9+ and a working environment where you can install packages.
  - A basic understanding of HTTP requests and JSON formatting.
- Quick setup
  - Copy the repository to your environment.
  - Create a new virtual environment to keep dependencies clean.
  - Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
  - Start the API server with a single command.
  - Point your client to the local server and try a sample request.

Environment and dependencies
- The project uses a streamlined dependency set to keep things simple and fast. It includes:
  - FastAPI for the web API
  - Uvicorn as the ASGI server
  - HTTP clients to call the OpenAI API
  - Helpers for prompt management, caching, and response handling
  - Optional notebooks support with Colab integrations
- How to install
  - Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
  - Activate the environment: source venv/bin/activate (Linux/macOS) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
  - Install: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Runtime considerations
  - The API is designed to run on a single machine. It’s suitable for local experiments or small-scale demos.
  - For production use, consider containerization or a cloud deployment pattern that includes load balancing and a robust secret manager.

Usage details
- Core endpoint
  - POST /pro-mode
  - Payload:
    - prompt: string containing the user query or task
    - num_gens: integer indicating how many generations to produce
  - Response: a structured object containing generations and metadata
- Prompt templates
  - Templates guide the model toward structured outputs, such as step-by-step reasoning, bullet lists, or JSON formats.
  - You can switch templates via configuration without changing the route or code.
- Output formats
  - Natural language explanations with optional sections
  - Bullet point outlines
  - Tables or JSON objects when appropriate
- Handling failures
  - The API returns clear error messages for common issues like missing API keys, invalid payloads, or timeouts.
  - Retry strategies are straightforward to implement in client code.

API usage guide
- Basic usage example
  - Prompt: Explain a concept in a few steps with a concrete example.
  - Generations: 5
  - Expected outcome: a consistent, easy-to-follow explanation with concrete details
- Advanced usage example
  - Prompt: Compare two methods for a given task, listing pros and cons
  - Generations: 3
  - Output: a side-by-side comparison with bullet points
- Handling long prompts
  - If prompts are long, consider splitting them into smaller tasks or using a guidance prompt that asks for concise outputs.
- Safety and boundaries
  - Pro Mode uses safe defaults to avoid harmful or dangerous content.
  - You can customize safety rules, but ensure you test thoroughly before sharing publicly.

Deployment and hosting
- Quick local deployment
  - Set OPENAI_API_KEY in your shell
  - Install dependencies
  - Run the server
- Production deployment ideas
  - Containerize the app with Docker
  - Use a minimal reverse proxy like Nginx
  - Provide a lightweight load balancer when you have multiple instances
  - Store secrets in a secure vault or environment manager
- Monitoring and observability
  - Basic logging is included
  - Consider integrating a metrics collector for request counts, latencies, and error rates
  - Add traces if you adopt a distributed architecture

Security and privacy
- API key handling
  - The API key is read from environment variables. Do not hard-code keys in code or config files.
  - Rotate keys regularly and restrict permissions to necessary scopes.
- Data handling
  - Be mindful of user prompts and responses. Decide how you want to log data, and consider anonymization where possible.
  - If you deploy publicly, ensure you have a data retention policy and user consent flow.
- Access control
  - For public deployments, implement authentication and rate limiting to prevent abuse.
  - Use TLS to protect data in transit.
